       "[\"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?\",\n",
       " 'Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone\\'s text messaging capabilities don\\'t work with Sprint\\'s system and won\\'t until a software patch comes out \"some time in the next few months\". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint\\'s award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed \"offline\" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest.',\n",
       " \"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...\",\n",
       " \"I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)\",\n",
       " 'The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time.',\n",
       " 'Hello, I have this phone and used it until I decided to buy a flip phone. I have had NO problems with the battery or new cases--it has a new fish case on it now and it stays as well as the original one. I have added ring tones, and music so it was all good for me--as a matter of fact I am willing to sell this phone, the home charger and the car charger for a great deal--email me--(...)',\n",
       " \"Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget.

       " \"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.\",\n",
       " \"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.\",\n",
       " 'This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.',\n",

When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I\\'ve had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn\\'t even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don\\'t have service, you don\\'t get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end.

The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability. The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on.

The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something.

I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about).

It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone\\'s features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for \"authorized personal only\", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method.

It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I\\'m calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I\\'m on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a \"+\" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example \"+15551212121\" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

So back to the Alias 2 the phone is easy to figure out but does not work in all the ways it is said to work. Specifically I can not get this phone to pair with my blue tooth in my new car. I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon. Considering the very large increase in the monthly charges they will thus receive and extending my contract I sincerely hope they work as hard to keep the customer happy as they say they do.

       " \"Just recently got this phone as a replacement to my i760 and am happy to be back to a flip phone. Great Camera, have not tested video yet. Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that. If you need a phone that syncs with outlook then get a pda phone. This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent. Interface is about the same as any other VZ flip phone I've had in the past. The ability to use a 16gb micro sd is also a nice feature and is especially handy if you have a card reader on your pc/laptop. All in all its a solid phone that serves the purpose its intended for...a phone thats easy to txt on and make calls on.\",\n",
       " 'Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It\\'s like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it\\'s really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I\\'m fully awake and alert :-) it\\'s hard to open and I\\'ve dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there\\'s no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock\\'s snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you\\'re on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn\\'t display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said \"Hey let\\'s meet later!\" and the person asks you \"Ok, what time is it now?\" and you can\\'t tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don\\'t they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren\\'t too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it\\'s like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to \"sync\" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they\\'ll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can\\'t select multiple photos at once. Won\\'t send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn\\'t carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like \"every other week\". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I\\'m off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don\\'t; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I\\'ll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn\\'t too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as \"fully integrated\" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn\\'t support accessing attachments. This is not what I call \"fully integrated\". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it\\'s an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university\\'s email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn\\'t too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone\\'s contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn\\'t clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don\\'t know...) Beware of Verizon\\'s compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn\\'t presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a \"web browsing plan\", not a \"data plan\". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my \"data plan\". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don\\'t know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it\\'d be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can\\'t. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small.',\n",
       " \"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung\\'s newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I\\'ve run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you\\'re in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I\\'ve had to learn that when I\\'m typing a text and the phone stops registering what I\\'m trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it\\'ll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn\\'t save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don\\'t change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there\\'s plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don\\'t flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn\\'t apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There\\'s a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can\\'t verify that it\\'s better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you\\'re considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don\\'t prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It\\'s probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it\\'s very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I\\'ve seen some complaints that this isn\\'t possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the \"Quick texts\" ... You have to have \"Auto-display text\" options set - a feature I didn\\'t discover until I\\'d had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven\\'t had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it\\'s up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I\\'m satifisied with it. After all, it\\'s phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I\\'m still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I\\'m lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!) I\\'m saving my money, however, and holding onto the trusty Alias 2.',\n",
       " \"The messaging features are nice. Typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard. Also, the screen is quite pretty. I have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature. When receiving calls, the phone works over half the time, but it sometimes resets when I attempt to answer calls. Also, at other times it lights up when a call is coming in, but won't actually finish the process and start ringing, so I don't know who actually called until they tell me later. I'm beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone, and I suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up.\",\n",

The keypad is a great size, even for my larger fingers. I would have given 5 stars, except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out.

Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother. The camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good. The battery in this phone doesn't last near as long as my old LG, however this phone has many more features, so I think the battery life is acceptable. It's got a sleek design and it's fun to use, however, I don't think I'd buy another one because of the usability issues.\",\n",

The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me.\",\n",

       " \"The first time I heard about the Samsung Alias I thought I was in for a unique phone/messaging experience. After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years.\",\n",
       " \"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: I am NOT a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash. I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.) This phone was a good choice for me, and I'm very happy with it.\",\n",
       " \"Calls are fine; battery life is terrific compared to the LG phone I just discarded. Nearly identical software found on every other Verizon phone I've had, yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad. Great camera, HOWEVER, no support Bluetooth file system profile -- nor support for marking multiple photos for push, meaning that I have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my PC via Bluetooth. So I should be done pushing the 100 or so pics I took today in about 28 days... lovely. Also, END key is right next to the SPACE key. If you inadvertently tap END while using the mobile web, it exits no matter what/where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you're trying to learn the keypad layout. Time on the front display is permanently set to 12-hr mode. I don't think I'm going to keep this one for long.\",\n",
       " \"The real standout feature on this phone is keyboard. I made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original LG chocolate from 3 years ago, especially since verizon just copies its old OS onto everything. The bluetooth stereo is almost unusable, very tinny, no way to adjust the sound profile. If you plug a wire in it sounds great, but not very useful. Phone call quality is ok. it has a spot for upto 16GB card, which would be perfect if it was useful as an MP3 player. If it wasn't too late to return it , I would. Also the Voice recognition is not accurate or useful, something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate.\",\n",
       " \"As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you. Pros: Durable Reliable good for texting Cons: A little slow sometimes It's slippery Not a smartphone but it's a cheap one The best secret feature is that if you scratch the back a certain way it makes a cool noise like scratching a record.\",\n",
       " 'I love the e-ink technology (the qwerty keyboard is great for texting), but that is the highlight. The huge drawback, if you need to make calls with the bluetooth, is that the voice activation system is useless. My old phone worked flawelessly in this area, but with the Alias 2, if I say, \"Call John Smith,\" IF it responds (and many times it doesn\\'t), it will say, \"Did you say dial 123?\" or some other number, or name that is nothing like the one I\\'ve said. It\\'s incredibly frustrating. I don\\'t want to look at my phone as I am driving, that is why I rely on the Voice Activation/Bluetooth to make my calls. Without voice activation working properly, I am looking at my phone, scrolling through my address book, and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road. SO DISAPPOINTING.',\n",

I \"upgraded\" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn\\'t want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn\\'t like their current non-smart phones. I\\'m guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don\\'t use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon\\'s better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn\\'t upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from \"Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)\" to \"Legacy/unsupported phone. Don\\'t waste your time to try again\". If I didn\\'t see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn\\'t see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online \"upgrade/replacement\" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn\\'t think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn\\'t want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don\\'t have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars.

The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.\",\n",

The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone. DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics.

This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It\\'s not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn\\'t the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I\\'m rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn\\'t for everyone; it has none of the smartphone \"flair\" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn\\'t lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.',\n",

It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use \"genuine\" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn\\'t have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than.

Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don\\'t even know that the equipment they are selling doesn\\'t work correctly (my seller didn\\'t even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn\\'t apply to you.

The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

       " 'Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon\\'s support community forum site (search for \"Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..\"). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone\\'s Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon\\'s tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word\\'s spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon\\'s review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought.

I figured I'd pay the extra money to get a Mil-spec phone and not have to worry about damage happening. I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone. I'd have had a lot more dollars in my pocket, since the Mil spec designation adds NOTHING! Other than that it's a pretty good phone. Just don't buy it for its ruggedness.\",\n",

It may be if you are in the military recruitment office. In the real world the first phone lasted only a little over a month before the flip section got broken off.

It\\'s a pretty sturdy phone, it\\'s lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it\\'s designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The \\'closed\\' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn\\'t sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof \"up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes\" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I\\'m sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I\\'m happy with this little guy.

Verizon tech support said the software was incompatible with their service and they were working on it even though the phone was made for Verizon with their logos and software. Catch two, the phone can be activated on Page Plus and has a better priced plan. The voice mail cannot be set up to work, even with tech support from Page Plus. Some Verizon features and programs will not work. Some bloatware cannot be uninstalled like the Bing search.

With this phone I go to three bars after about two days, and then quite quickly to two bars and one bar. I thought it might have come with an old battery, so I bought a replacement battery but I still had the same problem, so I suspect the phone is just an energy hog to some degree. I am a physician, and carried a smart phone primarily for the Internet, and a flip phone to make and receive phone calls so that I would not have to worry about the battery dying on me, so this is a bit of a disappointment.',\n",

Other times, when I'm talking on the phone a LOT (like all day long), the battery lasts for 12 or 14 hours.

It holds a charge quite well, and since it isn't one of the newer phones, I don't have to pay for a data plan. If you just need a basic phone with your Verizon cell service, this is a great choice. I called Verizon Customer Service to make the change from my old phone, quick and easy, although I had to re-enter all my contacts manually.

It is VERY simple and it STILL gets great reception compared to other verizon phones I've had. I still wouldn't call it rugged at all. But, for a penny- I think it is the best bet of all the 1 cent options, as it is still working great after 6 months and the fact that it weighs nothing and doesn't seem to contain any glass or metal as advertised has become less annoying as it has been consistently performing well. No problems since the early exchange for the dud. Maybe they just need to change their advertising angle as it isn't bad at all, but is NOT industrial grade. Because of it's consistently very high talk quality and ease of use, I have upped it a star. ____________________________ UPDATE: two months later... Returned the original phone because the screen kept going blank. Had no problems at Verizon with the exchange because it had been purchased within 30 days and have had no problems with the replacement phone. The reception is still VERY good and the Battery life long. But still... it is not a rugged phone by any stretch. There is no such thing as an industrial grade phone. Please Motorola, start making something in the USA! ----------------------------- Maybe this was designed to military specs, but it is just a cheap plastic phone... toy even. I don't know where the metal and glass is on this consumer version of what may have once been an industrial grade design. The hinge doesn't seem to be metal, it seems to be plastic although it could be aluminum or some other inexpensive and light metal. The screen doesn't seem to be glass, but plastic. screen goes completely white randomly, rendering it useless a good deal of the time. Don't know that it would survive even a 2 foot drop, since it didn't seem to make it through shipping without getting messed up. The product description is a joke compared to what was actually delivered. Looking for a rugged phone? Don't look to the Barrage unless appearances are all that matters. This phone should be heavy, it weighs nothing and feels cheap. I don't know that a truly rugged phone exists anymore. If Motorola won't make a quality product in the USA, there's no one that will. The only thing positive about this phone is that it does seem to get rather good reception when the screen isn't white. If Motorola wants to tout this phone as rugged, they need to use the original design components or change the description from metal and glass to thin plastic, made in China. Bottom Line - Looks Tough, feels weak. Good Reception. Rugged? HA... All Hat, No Cattle.\",\n",

       " 'I was in the market for a new phone, and I had the following list of desires: + Tetherable wireless modem. + Ruggedized + Uses the same USB interface as my wife\\'s and son\\'s phones I first ordered a different ruggedized VZW phone, because it was advertised with more features and was well reviewed. The problem was, the other brand of phone did not come with a USB cable, nor was one available. While I was searching around for the cable online, I tried out the extra features, such as the thermometer- it was off by 4 to 6 degrees Farenheit, making it pretty useless. The LED flashlight was nice, but not nicer than being able to surf the WEB surfside. So, I exchanged it for this much less glitzy Motorola Barrage. I have already used it to get my email and upload documents far from any available Wi-Fi hot spots (cool!) and it has come in handy when I am in the shower and I get an important phone call (like from my wife). It also uses the same cord as the other cell phones in the family, which is great on trips. It has some other surprisingly useful features. For example, I can make a call without looking at the phone because it pronounces the names of my contacts as I scroll through the list. Also, it is actually very useful to know who is calling without having to put down whatever I am carrying to look at the cell phone display. The voice recognition, e.g., \"Call... John... Mobile,\" actually work on this phone for me and that is a first. I already have several great digital cameras, so I always thought having a camera phone was sort of stupid. But the other day I bought something at the lumber store that didn\\'t have a sticker. No problem, I just snapped a picture of the display tag, and the cashier keyed the SKU right in. I put one of those 4 GB micro SD cards into the phone for $11 so I can transfer files back and forth from the phone to my laptop, or to other computers. That\\'s when one gewfy \\'feature\\' of the phone showed up. When you first plug it in to the USB cable, you get to choose between \"Media Sync Mode\" and \"Modem Mode.\" Choosing \"Media Sync\" gives you the option to either download music, or NOT. \"Not\" mode does nothing... nada... Zippo... except to charge the battery. If you want to transfer files or photos, you have to go into \"Tools\" and select \"USB Mass Storage.\" But even *that* is gewfy, because there are two menu items that have the phrase \\'USB\\'. To transfer files, you want the one that results from, \"MENU, Settings & Tools, 2. Tools, 8. USB Mass Storage,\" and *not* \"MENU, Settings & Tools, 9. USB Mode.\" Pretty stinkin\\' ridiculous, eh? The bluetooth pairing thingie works, but I can\\'t get used to making or answering calls on a headset. Plus, people who walk around in public talking to themselves seem icky to me. I might get a car adapter someday, and I am confident this phone will work with it. Other than that one weird menu glitch, I really, really like this phone.',\n",

The next full charge lasted about 3 days - HUH? The next full charge lasted less than a day - CRAP!!! Verizon gladly offered to exchange the phone - but they were \\'out of stock\\'. We waited several days for a replacement - only to learn that the phone was being discontinued and there would be NO new ones. A couple of these phones were finally located at a WalMart about 20 mile away - so, I made the trip and exchanged the phones. HOWEVER, her new phone was worse than the first.... the initial full charge lasted just a little over a day. I did an internet search and found this to be quite a common problem for this phone. I tried every posted \"fix\" to no avail. My wife grew tired of dealing with it and finally exchanged her Barrage for an LG Clout... which has performed flawlessly and gives her 5 days to a full charge. I\\'m just praying MY Barrage doesn\\'t peter out now. Maybe I\\'m lucky and got a \"good\" one. Other minor complaints.... the battery cover is hard to install properly - even the Verizon agent didn\\'t know how. If the cover is not FULLY seated, the phone WILL NOT be water resistant..... you can find this discussed on several different websites as well. Once you learn a few tricks, it becomes easier to do. The MP3 player interface is the quite dated and clunky old Verizon \"V Cast\".... it\\'s high time Verizon reworked this dinosaur into something a little more flexible. There is no graphic equalizer - heck, there\\'s not even a basic tone adjustment - so you\\'ll have to live with the fairly flat audio the player has. The headphone jack is 2.5mm - unfortunately, common headphones have a 3.5mm plug and won\\'t work without an adapter (I finally bought a pair of BlackBerry earbuds with a 2.5mm plug on Amazon for $4 and they work GREAT!!!). The Barrage is a bit thick compared to other flip phones and may be uncomfortable to hold in smaller hands. The thickness also makes finding a suitable case difficult. So - only 1 (out of 3) of these phones worked for us.... those are not great odds. I like mine so far - but I\\'m nervous that it won\\'t last and I can not recommend this phone without some serious reservations. If you\\'re seriously considering this phone (as Dirty Harry would say) you\\'ve got to ask yourself one question: \"Do I feel lucky?\" Well do ya, punk?',\n",

Even with the cases on, the phone was useless after only a month and a half. First the front screen cracked. No big deal, it happens on pretty much every phone I\\'ve had. But then, the main screen went blank, and I was left with trying to dial or pull up numbers blindly from memory. After a month and a half? very disappointed.

Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail.

I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all.

My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue. I carefully put a heavy bead of superglue around the PTT button. PTT hasn't activated in over a month, now I'm happy with the phone.\",\n",

The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections. IM is the only lockable internet ap in the Rugby II Tundra was able to usb connect to PC for data transfer. Rugby II has to have a mini sim card installed before it will even try.

I've had to terminate calls because I couldn't hear the ther party well enough to continue. I never had this problem with my old Motorola EM330. Texting is a chore with the poorly laid out format requiring you to change screens for simple punctuation or numeric functions. AT&T keeps trying to blame the reception issues on a local network problem. A coworker has an identical phone with the identical problem. Other coworkers with AT&T service, but different phones do not have this issue. As an MP3 player coupled with my Bluetooth it's great. As a phone, it leaves a lot to be desired.\",\n",

B/c of the false information AT&T gave me on multiple calls (5 calls!), I could not get a new, alternative brand phone. So, I was forced into The Rugby II. Well, I\\'m happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven\\'t had any dropped calls. I haven\\'t had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don\\'t seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it\\'s folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven\\'t found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they\\'ve been added. It\\'s bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I\\'m suddenly feeling lighter, I know I\\'ve left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn\\'t the phone you want. You\\'ll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven\\'t had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won\\'t SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they\\'re not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don\\'t know if there was a voice dial option, but it\\'s on the II. It\\'s just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don\\'t try to voice dial 911. You\\'ll die before the call\\'s been made (maybe I\\'m exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory\\'s decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more \"consumer-ized\" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. \"how does this damn thing work?\" \"Can\\'t you reboot it?\" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I\\'m getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I\\'ll review that soon, too. Potential Rugby II users: It\\'s not as super cool as other phones out there, but it\\'ll \\'git \\'er done.\\' Just be prepared to be patient. It\\'s NOT lightning fast.. Oh, and you still can\\'t read or reply to texts when you\\'re on a call, but you can send them. And that kind of defeats the purpose of texting.',\n",
       " 'My son is hard on his phones, so we purchased a Samsung Ruby I for him, which lasted over two years. When that phone broke, we decided to try the newer Rugby II. After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn\\'t know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a \"Rugged\" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung. He is now using a $20 Go-Phone from Wal-Mart with his ATT simm card and it has lasted much longer than the Samsung Rugby II.',\n",

Samsung tech support first told me I had a bad data cable, then that I needed to re-load the software, then finally admitted it wasn't going to work. No more Samsungs for me. One other slightly annoying thing about the phone is that the charging port is covered by a flimsy rubber flap that is hard to take off, and doesn't look like it will last the test of time with constant use.

The ever-reliable Nokia had served me faithfully for 7 full years when ATT determined that it couldn\\'t tolerate such superb service in its network. The planet\\'s largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a \"free\" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several \"free\" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, \"None,\" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a \"free\" phone, I\\'d need to buy the \"reliable\" model. 3. In \"upgrading\" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4. The PTT feature has been located such that it cannot be avoided--and which brings additional charges when used. (But this can be disabled. Pry out the button, then clip the stem from its back. Replace. You\\'ll be happy to have a less functional phone) If the young revolutionaries in Cairo had all had Rugbys last year, Mubarak could never have been toppled',\n",

Thus, there is a PTT key on the left-hand side of the phone that is extremely sensitive and almost unavoidable when you open or otherwise handle the phone. As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

Rather than glue it or clip the little nib that activates the PTT inside the button, what I did easy is and totally reversible: I pried the button out, smeared a little bit of RTV Silicone into the recess, replaced the button, wiped off the excess silicone and let it cure overnight. The button will no longer depress and activate the annoying PTT message, and if need be, I can simply reverse it by peeling the silicone out of the button recess. I used RTV Black Silicone gasket goop, but I am sure any silicone will do nicely. The RTV is nicely color matched and the excess wipes away easily.\",\n",

The other day I got the phone out of my pocket and the display was messed up. Took it to an AT&T store who told me that it was a pressure crack which couldn't be repaired and wasn't covered by warranty. They acknowledged that there was no exterior damage but said that there was nothing they could do for me other than sell me a new phone. I don't subject electronics to harsh treatment, in fact the phone has been very gently handled and shows no exterior wear or tear. How can Samsung and AT&T advertise this as a rugged phone? I'm extremely disappointed that neither of them stand by this product or their customer service. BTW - The other reviewer comments about the placement of the PTT and browser buttons are so true. Accidental activation of these services are constantly inevitable with this phone.\",\n",

For a couple of months this phone worked fine ... and yes, took some minor abuse in stride. And then, the other day I reached into my pocket for my car keys, and the phone fell out. The case broke apart where the phone flips on the right side ... and now some of the electronics are exposed. It fell about three feet onto the asphalt. I was told that it could take \"punishment\" up to a 30 foot fall. It makes me wonder a bit about the military specifications mentioned in the paperwork and various sites I\\'ve seen.

My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw. I'm looking forward to Apple finally getting the iPhone somewhere else so AT&T's subscriber pen get's busted open and they finally have to stop shaking down customers for accidental service in order to retain them.

       " 'Somebody has to tell the Samsung people that this phone has serious problem connecting to PC\\'s. I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn\\'t help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that\\'s it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the \\'mass storage\\' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn\\'t work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung \"New PC Studio\" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung \"New PC Studio\" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not \\'sync\\' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today\\'s world, an \\'advanced\\' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not \\'sync\\' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable. There are also no updates or upgrades to the phone software available yet. I have also called AT&T and they don\\'t know anything at all about this problem or care at all about it. They believe is a Samsung problem and not their problem to resolve. It is a total shame, because apart from this serious problem, that is still unresolved by Samsung, the phone is an average phone that works.',\n",

The too-easily-to-accidentally-press PTT button is really annoying like others have said. I fixed it by disassembly the phone to remove the button. I then put a thin piece of silicone tubing behind the button, making it much harder to inadvertently press, but still functional. The earphone volume seems too low initially, but now seems fine.

       " \"So within a few months of owning the phone, it began to turn itself off CONSTANTLY. It didn't seem random...rather, it seemed to happen when the phone rang and I attempted to pick it up. Other times it would just shut off in my pocket. I became obsessed with checking the phone to ensure it was still on since I used the phone for my job, and like most working folks, my phone calls are super important. Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now. I started using my old Samsung Propel - which suffered severe water damage and worked nonetheless, btw - and am infinitely more pleased. I just purchased a new model propel on Amazon and am looking forward to delivery.\",\n",

       " \"I've had this phone for over a year now and have to say, it's done quite well for me. It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.\",\n",
       " '. . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating \"push to talk\" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too. I guess many of you love your Rugby phones, and I am glad you had better experiences with yours than I did with either of the two I tried.',\n",
       " \"After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.\",\n",

I clicked the activate option and was put on hold for a very reasonable period of time while being entertained by Spanish guitar music. The marketing rep answered. To my amazement the rep informed me that I had won a $500 gift and that all I needed to do was pay $14.95 to have it shipped to my door. I reported that I was not interested in the gift but the marketer was persistent. I finally hung up without activation. The next day I tried again and dialed *611. The support person gave me a toll free number where I could pursue activation. I dialed the number and once again was greeted by a marketer who explained that I had won $500. After asking how his company could survive by giving away so many $500 gifts for $20 phone purchases the marketer told me I could bypass his office and attain activation by dialing the number again an pressing \"option 3\". After I hung up I was unable to locate \"option 3\", so here I sit with a phone hosted by a company that obviously makes it immmensely difficult to activate without accepting a $500 gift.

Similarly I've had friends ask why I didn't text them back, when I never received it. On the phone itself, it's a basic no thrills package. You can't zoom in on pictures.

So we get it home and try to install the software so we can transfer ringtones and photos to and from it, but the Verizon software wont install, and says it wont work on our 64 bit PC running Win 7!

No-one at the Verizon store in Phoenix, AZ has a clue why it wouldn't work. Works fine when they test it at the store, because it's just a few minutes from the current time.

       " 'My old Motorola 120e bar phone was wearing out (literally) after 8 years...I couldn\\'t even see the numbers on the buttons any more. Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera \"feature\" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn\\'t work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won\\'t work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn\\'t even know this, and Samsung doesn\\'t point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone\\'s screen. That\\'s it. So, don\\'t waste your money expecting this to be anything more than a telephone. It works just fine as a telephone-but that\\'s it.',\n",

To my amazement, we put the phone back together and the phone worked immediately, only had some minor cosmetic damage. Last night we had a terrible storm and the phone was plugged in and charging. A transformer blew outside and a power surge rushed through my house. The phone started smoking and the back cover melted. The inside is scortched and smells like an electrical fire. To my amazement, after the phone cooled off and stopped smoking, we attempted to turn it on. The phone turned on and worked beautifully!!! I think this phone is indestructible!

After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well. Three things make an impression on me. 1) This phone is small. Not clunky. 2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet! 3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that. The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase. The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger. Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores. I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call. Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also.

I have a landline phone at home so the T201G is used for emergency use, away from home use, etc. I purchase only 200 mins per month with a plan that cost about 7.5 cents per minute. With tax, about $16.70 per month for the 200 minutes and service. Any leftover minutes roll over each month and are never lost as long as you keep the service. This phone and the Net10 service have been excellent in my opinion. Talk time is around 4 hours and standby time is almost 2 weeks before charging is needed. I even purchased a spare battery for when we travel and alternate batteries every couple months. I love it when my wife goes shopping in town and can keep in touch for such a low monthly cost. If you only need a phone part time for emergency, travel, etc., this is a great bargain. Highly recommend.',\n",

I got tired of being on a plan, so I went from a package with AT&T to a pay-as-you-go with AT&T. When rates started inching up and my bill cost more, it was time for me to switch. I stumbled upon Net10. They had flip phones, carry over minutes and cost effective pay-as-you-go. I ordered the phone plus accessories. It arrived quickly! Set-up was prompt when I called in and I have that phone, Motorola V171, to this day. I am currently looking to change, as my family puts it, \"catch up with 2008, at least\" so I am getting a phone that will accept photo texts, so that my sisters can send me photos of my nieces. Now to inform you why I scored them a 4 instead of a 5. - The customer service is not what is was when I first signed up with them. When I do call in for a question it takes FOREVER to get someone and then once I do, we have a language barrier, so BE PATIENT. - I hate that they got rid of their 1 year pre-paid card 1500 minutes for $150 or $100 (I can\\'t remember which one Now there is a $100 card for 1000 minutes lasting 9 months, I believe. Other than that, if you are in to fancy phones and you\\'re a HEAVY phone user, Net10 may not be for you. They have 2 pay plans $15(150 minutes) and $25 per month(250 minutes)none are roll over. Then there is the pay-as-you-go (with roll over minutes). They don\\'t carry iphones and their phones are approx. 2 years behind the lastest and greatest.

       " 'Purchased used from NuTwo on Amazon. It was rated as in \"very good\" condition. I would rate it as in excellent condition. The packaging was professional / good quality. The phone arrived ahead of schedule. Highly recommend seller. Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I\\'m over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won\\'t push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it\\'s Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I\\'m hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven\\'t really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven\\'t landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you\\'re going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can\\'t say much other than it appears to work well. I really don\\'t browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us \"throw back\" flip phone users who aren\\'t ready for a smart phone yet. This phone has more capability than I will ever use. I have only scratched the surface of the software options.',\n",
       " 'This purchase has been an outstanding experience. This is the same model phone that Consumer Reports rated a best buy at the time I bought it the first time 10 years ago or more. Customer reviews of subsequent models have said that this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a rugged phone with great voice quality and a lit keypad with keys big enough for my big hands. By rugged I mean that I dropped my first one on the floor a number of times over the years without breaking it. I got Verizon on the phone and made sure my contacts were backed up and then activated the phone. Easy! As for TargetWireless, I started by asking them a question. I had an answer back within two hours. I ordered the phone. They shipped it the same day. It arrived earlier than promised, looking new in a small white box with places for the phone and charger, both in little plastic bags. It even has clear thin protective covers on the displays! It seems every bit as good as the one I bought new years ago. Thank you!\\xa0Samsung Convoy SCH-U640 Cell Phone Ruggedized PTT 2+ megapixel Camera for Verizon',\n",

After paying for this and getting nothing to charge it with, I am now with a completely useless phone. For the amount paid to get the phone AND get a charger, I could have went with someone else OR purchased another phone. So, if you're looking to get a phone here, I'm sure they are great but don't assume it has everything you need. It didn't. Here's what I've got- it looks good but is completely useless. This, by the way, is more on me for not looking at the right details or asking the right questions. Just the same, it's useless at the moment and I'm rather irritated at having paid as much when I could have gotten something better and more to the point, one that came with everything I needed to be able to use it. The seller was correct on everything else; it is exactly as advertised. Just make sure you get the damn charger.\",\n",

It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?\n",
      "neg : Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out \"some time in the next few months\". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed \"offline\" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest.\n",
      "pos : This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...\n",
      "neg : I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)\n",
      "neutral : The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time.\n",
      "pos : Hello, I have this phone and used it until I decided to buy a flip phone. I have had NO problems with the battery or new cases--it has a new fish case on it now and it stays as well as the original one. I have added ring tones, and music so it was all good for me--as a matter of fact I am willing to sell this phone, the home charger and the car charger for a great deal--email me--(...)\n",
      "pos : Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget. And oh, if you're thinking of getting this for a teenager, you've come to the right phone; they'll go crazy after its looks AND its color LCD (which happens to be a little oversize). If this phone's goin' for an adult, you've hit da soda pop again, you lucky person! NOW are ya convinced that this mobile's REAL! (it is).\n",
      "neutral : The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset.\n",
      "neg : I've never owned a Nokia phone before, so this is a first for me. I really like the phone alot, the reception is great...even though the signal strength show's being low. The quality of the phone is great too, it feels sturdy and weighted. I highly recommend this phone.\n",
      "neg : ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.\n",
      "neg : I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.\n"

      "neg : 1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.\n",
      "neg : I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.\n",
      "neg : This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.\n",
      "neg : DON'T BUY OUT OF SERVICE\n",
      "pos : I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.\n",
      "neg : I just got it and have to say its easy to use, i can hear the person talking just fine and i have had no problems dealing with nextel.\n",
      "neg : 1 star because the phones locked so I have to pay additional fees to unlock it\n",
      "pos : The product has been very good. I had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders. I will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it....\n",
      "neg : My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message \"network not available\". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.\n",

      "neg : I bought this phone to replace an LG phone that I didn't like. As I expected, all I had to do was put the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked. There are two serious drawbacks to this device, both related to the candy bar style. First, all the buttons are exposed, so it's easy to hit one accidentally. Second, the screen is easily scratched. This one got scratched making it difficult to read in sunlight. Aside from those two flaws, the phone works great. Connectivity, battery life, and quality of voice are superb. Since I don't do texting I can't comment on that. It is nice and small, and if it came with a case, or if I could find a case for it, then it would be perfect for my needs. The price was right. Now I have a new SIM card with $10 worth of calling on it that I don't need.\n"
